This project is one of my first none academic realization, where i will try to realize a fully functional statless e-commerce platform. </br>
The main idea is to build a fully functional web application, that satisfy the criteria of the clean architectur and good system design. </br>
<h3>The app was designed to be :</h3> 
<h5>Reliable:</h5> It will be functional and even more importantclean of fatalities, sure have some errors, but fatality is crucial and will be avoided, even if the system grows.
<h5>Scalable:</h5> The app must support the weight of future requests growth, meaning that even if the amount of request grow with time the application shall keep it functionality and works fine.
<h5>Mintanable:</h5> The posibility to maintain the app with lowst cost and least effort, and also the abilty to upgrade it.
